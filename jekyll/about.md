<h2>About The Partnership Garden</h2>

<a name='mission'></a>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>To build a diverse collaborative community committed to growing a sustainable organic garden at the School of Environmental Studies while learning, sharing, and teaching each other about gardening in partnership with nature and to inspire other school gardens as well as other edible gardens throughout our communities.</p>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>

</div>
<p>Gardeners across generations, cultures, economic backgrounds, and skill levels will partner with each other and nature to grow and explore growing healthy food. Collaboratively creating a beautiful sustainable organic garden at the School of Environmental Studies in Apple Valley, we will:
<ol>
<li>Broaden the school’s educational opportunities, extend its community outreach, and enhance its physical surroundings. The Partnership Garden will be an additional resource to teach SES students essential life skills, complement and reinforce their classroom education, provide direct hands-on environmental stewardship, and inspire them to make positive healthy choices for themselves, their local community, and the planet.</li>
<li>Nurture and grow a new diverse community committed to learning, sharing and teaching each other about sustainable organic gardening, including growing and eating healthy food in partnership with nature.</li>
<li>Learn, model and share sustainable <a href='{{site_url}}/resources/'>permaculture</a> gardening techniques, native plants, and new foods across generations, cultures and skill levels.</li>
<li>Inspire the growth of incredible edible communities with gardens and orchards everywhere ─ in front of city halls, in our school yards, at the entrance to our cafes, in our parks, in local greenhouses, with food connecting us all into one happy, healthy community.</li>

</ol>
