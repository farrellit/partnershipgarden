<h3>Permaculture</h3>

<h4>What is Permaculture?</h4>

<p>Working with nature, not against it. A holistic approach to land use that “aims to create stable, productive systems that provide for human needs harmoniously integrating the land with people” (Bill Mollison).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“While many people think of permaculture as gardening, that's a lot like thinking of math as being about building bridges.  Permaculture is a sustainable design science rooted in observation of natural patterns.  For example, the same branching pattern of a tree is present in every river, as well as in our own bodies -- the pattern maximizes edge, increases diversity, and serves at least a dozen other functions.”</p>

<h4>Ethics of Permaculture</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Care for the earth (husband soil, forests and water)</li>
<li>Care for people (look after self, kin and community)</li>
<li>Fair share (set limits to consumption and reproduction, and redistribute surplus)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>The Twelve Principles of Permaculture</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Observe and Interact</li>
<li>Catch and Store Energy</li>
<li>Obtain a Yield</li>
<li>Apply Self-regulation and Accept Feedback</li>
<li>Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services</li>
<li>Produce No Waste</li>
<li>Design From Patterns to Details </li>
<li>Integrate Rather than Segregate</li>
<li>Use Small and Slow Solutions</li>
<li>Use and Value Diversity</li>
<li>Use Edges and Value the Marginal</li>
<li>Creatively Use and Respond to Change</li>
</ol>
</ul>
